Created in 1983, [**the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority**](http://www.icjia.state.il.us) is a state agency dedicated to improving the administration of criminal justice.

The Authority brings together key leaders from the justice system and the public to identify critical issues facing the criminal justice system in Illinois, and to propose and evaluate policies, programs, and legislation that address those issues. The agency also works to ensure the criminal justice system in Illinois is efficient and effective. The Authority's specific powers and duties are detailed in the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Act [[**20 ILCS 3930 et. seq.**](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=397&ChapterID=5)].
