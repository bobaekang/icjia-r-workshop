This workshop is planned to offer a gentle introduction to the R programming language for ICJIA researchers who want to leverage the power and flexibility of R to improve their technical prowess as researcher.

# Workshop curriculum (*in development*)
The workshop consists of six separate modules which are meant to be followed in order. The goal of this workshop is help its participants to get familiar with basic concepts and tools for using R for data analysis tasks and research projects.

## Module 1: Introduction to R
In this module, participants will be introduced to the R language and the benefits of using R for their research projects. They will also get familiar with the R Studio IDE. An overview of the entire workshop curriculum is provided at the end of the module.

* R language
* Why R?
* comparison
    * with Excel
    * with SPSS
    * with Python
* R Studio
* basic workflow
* workshop overview

## Module 2: R basics
Here, participants will learn the basic building blocks of R language. Once participants gain some knowledge in the fundamental topics, they will be introduced to the popular `tidyverse` framework and provided with a recommendation as to a "good" style for coding in R.

### Part 1: Fundamental building blocks of R programming
* Objects
    * vectors
    * lists
* Expressions
    * operators
    * flow control (loops and conditionals)
* Functions
* Environments

Part 2: Gearing up for data analysis in R
* Data frame
    * creating a data frame
    * modifying a data frame
    * extending data frame (tibble and data.table)
* Add-on packages
* Tidyverse framework
* Style guide

## Module 3: Data analysis in R
This module focuses on manimuplating and transforming tabular data using R. Participants will learn how to import data into R environment and use common `tidyverse` syntax to clean and analyze data. Specifically, core functions from dplyr, tidyr, stringr, and lubridate packages will be covered.

### Part 1: Getting started with tidyverse
* Manipulating data
    * the `dplyr` package
* Tidying up data
    * the `tidyr` package

### Part 2: More on data manipulation
* Working with strings
    * the `stringr` package
    * regular expressions
* Working with datetimes
    * the lubridate package
* Importing/exporting data
    * CSV files
    * Excel spreadsheets
    * SPSS data files
    * `feather`

## Module 4: Data visualization in R
In this module, participants will get started with generating plots to visually present and communicate insights from data. The main focus of this module is the popular ggplot2 package. Participants will also be introduced to some options for generating maps and interactive plots.

### Part 1: The Grammar of Graphics
* Base R plots
* The grammer of graphics
    * the `ggplot2` package
* Some guidelines

### Part 2: Advanced visualiation
* Maps
    * spatial data object in R
    * the `rgdal` pacakge
    * the `ggmap` package
    * the `tmap` package
* Interactive plots
    * the `plotly` package
    * the `highcharter` package


## Module 5: Statistical analysis in R
In this module, participants will learn how to conduct basic statistical analysis with R. 

* Linear models
    * fitting models
    * inspecting fitted models
* Generalized linear models
    * for binary data
    * for count data
* Advanced modeling
    * time series analysis
    * survival analysis
    * machine learning


## Module 6: Sharing your analysis and more
This module will introduce participants to various ways to share their work by using R Markdown, R Presentation, and Shiny. 

* R Markdown and R notebooks
* R presentation
* Shiny applications
* What's next?
    * custom formatting with CSS
    * modularization
    * creating R packages
    * bookdown and blogdown
* Wrapping up
