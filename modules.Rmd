The workshop consists of six separate modules which are meant to be followed in order. Each module has a specific focus. The goal of this workshop is help its participants to get familiar with basic concepts and tools for using R for data analysis tasks and research projects.

Read the below to get an overview of each module and follow the links to relevant workshop materials. Enjoy!  

***

# Module 1: Introduction to R
In this module, participants will be introduced to the R language and the benefits of using R for their research projects. They will also get familiar with the R Studio IDE. An overview of the entire workshop curriculum is provided at the end of the module.

* [**Slides**](slides/module1_slides.html)
* [**Notes**](notes/module1_notes.html)

***

# Module 2: R basics
Here, participants will learn the basic building blocks of R language. Once participants gain some knowledge in the fundamental topics, they will be introduced to the popular `tidyverse` framework and provided with a recommendation as to a "good" style for coding in R.

### Part 1: Fundamental building blocks of R programming

* [**Slides**](slides/module2_slides1.html)
* [**Notes**](notes/module2_notes1.html) (currently unavailable)

### Part 2: Gearing up for data analysis in R

* [**Slides**](slides/module2_slides1.html)
* [**Notes**](notes/module2_notes1.html) (currently unavailable)

# Module 3: Data analysis in R
This module focuses on manimuplating and transforming tabular data using R. Participants will learn how to import data into R environment and use common "tidyverse" syntax to clean and analyze data. Specifically, core functions from `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `stringr`, and `lubridate` packages will be covered.

### Part 1: Getting started with tidyverse

* [**Slides**](slides/module3_slides1.html) (in development)
* [**Notes**](notes/module3_notes1.html) (currently unavailable)

### Part 2: More on data manipulation

* [**Slides**](slides/module3_slides2.html) (in development)
* [**Notes**](notes/module3_notes2.html) (currently unavailable)

# Module 4: Data visualiation in R
In this module, participants will get started with generating plots to visually present and communicate insights from data. The main focus of this module is the popular `ggplot2` package. Participants will also be introduced to some options for generating maps and interactive plots.

### Part 1: The Grammar of Graphics

* [**Slides**](slides/module4_slides1.html) (currently unavailable)
