In Module 3, we will be exploring several `tidyverse` packages that offer powerful functionalities for data analysis.

***


# Getting Ready

## Installing the packages

`tidyverse` is a set of R packages as well as an opinionated philosophy underlying these packages on how the practice of working with data in R should be. Although it is not the only way of working with data in R, `tidyverse` packages have become highly popular among R users.   

Installing all `tidyverse` packages can be easily done with the follwoing command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hadley/tidyverse")
```

Installing `tidyverse` package installs the following:
  * core tidyverse packages
      * `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`
  * packages to work with specific vector types 
      * `hms`, `stringr`, `lubridate`, `forcats`
  * packages to import data
      * `feather`, `haven`, `httr`, `jsonlite`, `readxl`, `rvest`, `xml2`
  * packages to facilitate statistical modeling
      * `modelr`, `broom`

Alternatively, each pacakge can be installed separately:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install ggplot2
install.packages("ggplot2")

# Install both dplyr and tidyr with a single commend
#   with a character vector of the package names 
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr"))
```


## Importing the packages

Once installed, we can now import the packages using `library()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This imports the core tidyverse packages
library(tidyverse)

# Or import packages separately
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

In the following, we will explore two powerful `tidyverse` packages for wrangling tabluar data, `dplyr` and `tidyr`.

## Key dplyr functions

In this section, we will learn the following `dplyr` functions:

* `arange()`
* `select()` `rename()`
* `filter()`
* `mutate()` `transmute()`
* `left_join()`
* `summarise()`
* `group_by()` `ungroup()`
* `%>%`, the pipe operator

Please note that this section is not intended to be an exhaustive documentation and description of the listed functions--or `dplyr` package for that matter. For more information, please check out the reference materials listed [below](#dplyr_more).


## Sort rows by variables

```{r eval=FALSE}
arrange(tbl, ...)
```

`arrange()` is used to sort the rows by a selection of column variables. The first argument of `arrange()` is a tabular data object. In fact, as we will see soon, almost all other functions of `tidyverse` packages take a data object as the first input. This tabular data can be of the `data.frame` class or any of its extensions, such as `tidyverse`'s very own `tibble` class.

`arrange()` takes columns by which to sort the data as additional arguments. If multiple columns are provided, the sorting taks place in a hierarchical manner: the data is first sorted by the first column, then by the second column, and so on. By default, sorting is in an ascending order (smaller to larger). Sorting in a descending order can be done by wrapping the column with `desc()`.

### Example

The following example sorts, or arranges, the `ispcrime` data by the `county` column. To make it manageable, we also use the `head()` to print only the first few rows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# without using pipe
head(arrange(ispcrime, county))

# with using pipe
ispcrime %>%
  arrange(county) %>%
  head()
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
ispcrime %>%
  arrange(county) %>%
  head()
```

As shown above, there are two ways to work with `dplyr` functions:

1. Traditional syntax for using R functions
2. Using pipe operators, `%>%`

We will take a closer look at `%>%` [below](#pipe). In the meantime, it is sufficient to note that the object before `%>%` is fed, or "piped," into the following function as the input for its first argument.

The folloiwng code illustrates using `desc()` to sort in a descending order:

```{r}
# sort by county, in a DESCENDING order
ispcrime %>%
  arrange(desc(county)) %>%
  head() 
```


## Filter rows with conditions

```{r eval=FALSE}
filter(tbl, ...)
```

`filter()` is used to filter data to keep rows that match given conditions. As in `arrange()`, the first argument is a tabular data object. Conditional expressions to filter data, which should evaluate as `TRUE` or `FALSE` for each row, are given as additional arguments.

### Example

The following code filters `ispcrime` to return a subset of data where  `year` value matches 2015 *AND* `murder` value is greater than 0. As before, we use `head()` to show only the first few rows. 

```{r}
ispcrime %>%
  filter(
    year == 2015,
    murder > 0
  ) %>%
  head()
```


## Select and/or rename variables
```{r eval=FALSE}
select(tbl, ...)
rename(tbl, ...)
```

`select()` and `rename()` both take a tabular data object as the first argument input. The following arguments are columns to select or rename. These two functions are quite similar to each other, except that `select()` returns the selected columns only while `rename()` keeps all columns.

It is actually possible to renaming each selected column with `select()` as well. `select()` can be also used to exclude a section of columns using a minus (`-`) sign while keeping the rest.
    
### Example

Let's take a look at an example on how to use `select()` to select columns, with changing their names in certain cases. The following code select four columns of `ispcrime` while changing the names of `violentCrime` and `propertyCrime` columns.

```{r}
# select with renaming columns
ispcrime %>%
  select(year, county, v_crime = violentCrime, p_crime = propertyCrime) %>%
  head()
```

As noted earlier, `select()` can be used to exclude certain columns. The following code selects all columns of `ispcrime` *except* `violentCrime` and `propertyCrime`:

```{r}
# excluding columns
ispcrime %>%
  select(-violentCrime, -propertyCrime) %>%
  head()
```


## Transform and add variables
```{r eval=FALSE}
transmute(tbl, ...)
mutate(tbl, ...)
```

`transmute()` and `mutate()` both take a tabular data object as the first argument input. The following arguments are expressions to transform existing columns or add new ones. An exisiting column is modified with an expression with the same column name. On the other hand, a new column is created with an expression having a new column name.

As with `select()` and `rename()`, the two functions here are quite similar to each other, except that `transmute()` returns the trasnformed/aded columns only while `mutate()` keeps all columns.

### Example

The following code adds a new column named `totalCrime`, whose value equals the sum of `violentCrime` and `propertyCrime` values:

```{r}
ispcrime %>%
  mutate(totalCrime = violentCrime + propertyCrime) %>%
  head()
```

If it were with `transmute()`, the result would include only the `totalCrime` column.


## Merge tables
```{r eval=FALSE}
left_join(tbl1, tbl2, by = NULL, ...)
```

`left_join()` takes two tabular data objects to join as the first two arguments. `by` takes a chracter vector containing a selection of variables to join tables by. By default, all columns with common names are used. The ouput is a merged table where the columns in the second table is added to the first table as new columns where the values of `by` columns match.

`left_join()` is named so because it keeps all observations in the first (left) table. There, in fact, are other types of joins including: `inner_join()`, `right_join()`, `full_join()`, `semi_join()`, and `anti_join()`.

The following four Venn diagrams show how different types of join compare to one another in terms of the observations (rows):

Source: Wickham, H. (2017). <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html"><span href="font-style:italic">R for Data Science</span></a>
</div>

### Example

The following code left-joins `regions` table to `ispcrime` table on the `county` values. The `regions` table has two columns: `region` and `county`. Accordingly, the final output is basically the `ispcrime` table with one extra column, `region`, that corresponds to the `county` value:

```{r}
ispcrime %>%
  left_join(regions, by = "county") %>%
  head()
```


## Aggregate and summarise rows
```{r eval=FALSE}
summarise(tbl, ...)
summarize(tbl, ...)
```

`summarise()` and `summairze()` are identical except who they are spelled. This is because the original package author, Hadly Wickham, is an Australian and wrote the names accordingly. Later, due to the demand from American programmers, `summarize()` was added.

`summarise()` takes a tabular data object as its first argument, and the following arguments are expressions to "summarize" data. Each of these expressions creates a summary column, which can be given a name just as in the case of `transmute()` or `mutate()`.

### Example

Here, we use `summarise()` to get the average count of `violentCrime` and `propertyCrime`, which are named `violentCrimeAverage` and `propertyCrimeAverage` respectively:

```{r}
ispcrime %>%
  summarise(
    violentCrimeAverage = mean(violentCrime, na.rm = TRUE),
    propertyCrimeAverage = mean(propertyCrime, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```


## Group by variables
```{r eval=FALSE}
group_by(tbl, ...)
ungroup(tbl, ...)
```

`group_by` is a powerful function that allows us to manipulate a data object in "groups," which is defined by the discrete values in a column, or a selection of columns. As in other `dplyr` functions, the first argument is a tabular object. The following arguments are columns by which to group the data.

`group_by()` and `ungroup()` are the opposite operations. `group_by()` creates a data object with groups. `ungroup()` removes the groups.

### Example

The following example shows how a groupd data table looks like: 

```{r}
ispcrime %>%
  group_by(year)
```

Now, let's see how `group_by()` can be used in combination with another `dplyr` function. In the following, we group our data by `year` values and get summaries (average crime counts) for each year:

```{r}
ispcrime %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    violentCrimeAverage = mean(violentCrime, na.rm = TRUE),
    propertyCrimeAverage = mean(propertyCrime, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```


## Chain operations {#pipe}

We have been using the pipe operator, `%>%`, in our code examples. Now is a good time to take a closer look at it.

```{r eval=FALSE}
data %>% function1(arg2, ...) %>% ...
```

`%>%` is a binary operator that requires two objects for it to work on. Think of `+` as another example of a binary operator. In the case of `%>%` the object preciding the operator has to be the first argument for the function that follows the oprator. In other words, the preceding object is injected into the following function as its first argument. The result of the `%>%` operator is the output of the function.

In fact, as we have already seen before, multiple functions can be chained, or "piped," using `%>%` as long as the output of the first "piping" generates a suitable object for the first argument of the next function to be chained.

with piping, we can have a coding style that is cleaner and more intuitive--that reflects the way we think about how we apply the operations to the object, rather than the tranditional syntax where the function that acts on the last comes at the beginning of the statement:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# piping style
object %>%
  function1(arguments1) %>%
  function2(arguments2) %>%
  function3(arguments3)


# traditional style
function3(
  function2(
    function1(
      object,
      arguments1
    ),
    arguments2
  ),
  arguments3  
  
)

# or
function3(function2(function1(object, arguments1), arguments2), arguments3)
```


## `dplyr` in action

Let's take a look at more concrete examples of using `dplyr` functions to work on data manipulation and analysis. For those of you who were there at my presentation for the February R&A meeting, these are the some of the examples used in that presentation--now we can understand them better!

### Example 1

```{r}
ispcrime %>%
  filter(substr(county, 1, 1) == "D", year %in% c(2014, 2015)) %>%
  mutate(totalCrime = violentCrime + propertyCrime) %>%
  select(year, county, totalCrime)
```

In this example, we we want to answer the following question: What are the total crime count in 2014 and 2015 for counties whose name starts with letter D?

1. We start with `ispcrime` data
2. We use the pipe operator to feed the `ispcrime` data into `filter()`
    * we have two filtering conditions. First condition is that the first letter of the `county` column value matches "D" (`substr(county, 1, 1) == "D"`)
    * Second condition is that the `year` column value has to be either 2014 or 2015 (`year %in% c(2014, 2015)`)
3. We use the pipe operator to feed the filtered data into `mutate()`
    * Here we create a new column named `totalCrime`, which is the sume of `violentCrime` and `propertyCrime` values
4. Finally, we use the filtered *and* mutated data into `select()`
    * The final output will include `year`, `county`, and `totalCrime` columns only.


### Example 2
```{r message=FALSE}
ispcrime %>%
  left_join(regions) %>%
  group_by(region, county) %>%
  summarise(annualAvgCrime = sum(violentCrime, propertyCrime, na.rm = TRUE) / n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(annualAvgCrime))
```

In this example, we we want to answer the following question: what is the annual average of the crime count per county, shown with the region it belongs to and sorted by the average count?

1. We start with `ispcrime` data
2. We use the pipe operator to feed the `ispcrime` data into `left_join()`
    * This is to add `region` column from `regions` table to our data
3. We use the pipe operator to feed the joined data into `group_by()`
    * We group the data by values of the `region` and `county` column.
4. We use the pipe operator to feed the grouped data into `summarise()`
    * We summarise data by group to get the annual average crime, a sum of `violentCrime` and `propertyCrime`, divided by total counts. Since the input is grouped, the summarising work is also done by group. 
5. We use the pipe operator to feed the grouped and summarised data into `arrange()`
    * Here we sort the data by the newly created column, `annualAvgCrime`, in a descending order
    

## More on `dplyr` {#dplyr_more}

What we have seen is only a tip of an iceberg that is `dplyr`. Although the aforementioned functions are among the most commonly used in usual data manipulation and analysis tasks, the description and examples here are by no means comprehensive. Also, `dplyr` offers many other functions to facilitate data manipulation work. I recommend you to check out the following resources to learn more about `dplyr`:

* `dplyr` on [tidyverse.org](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
* `dplyr` [CRAN documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf)

</div>

We have learned the notion of "tidy" data in the second part of the previous module. In short, a dataset is "tidy" when:

1. Each column is a variable
2. Each row is an observation
3. Each cell is a value.


## Key `tidyr` functions

In this section, we will learn the following `tidyr` functions:

* `gather()`
* `spread()`
* `unite()`
* `separate()`
* `separate_rows()`

Please note that, as before, this section is not intended to be an exhaustive documentation and description. For more information, please check out the reference materials listed [below](#tidyr_more).


## Make "wide" data longer
```{r eval=FALSE}
gather(tbl, key = "key", value = "value", ..., na.rm = FALSE, ...)
```
`gather()` is a function to make "wide" data longer, by "gathering" multiple columns into two columns of key-value pairs. The function takes a tabular data object, such as `data.frame` or `tibble`, as its first argument. The second argument, `key`, defines the name of a new column for key and the third argument, `value`, defines the name of a new column for value. These two arguments have default values that are, not surprisingly, `"key"` and `"value"`, respectively.

The following arguments (`...`) are a selection of columns to be used whose name will be made into values for the `key` column and whose value will be made into the values of the `value` column.


## Make "long" data wider
```{r eval=FALSE}
spread(tbl, key, value, fill = NA, ...)
```
`spread()` is the opposite of `gather()`. As in `gather()`, the first argument is a tabular data object. Then, `key` is an existing column containing the names of new columns, and `value` is another column containing the values for the new columns.


### Example
Let's take a look at an example illustrating how `gather()` and `spread()` work. First, we prepare a data to be used, which is the familiar `ispcrime` dataset, except we exclude `violentCrime` and `propertyCrime` columns using `select()`. We assign this to `ispcrime_2`. 

```{r}
ispcrime_2 <- ispcrime %>%
  select(-violentCrime, -propertyCrime) %>%
  as_tibble()

ispcrime_2
```

Now, let's try `gather()`. We will name the key column `type` for the type of crime, and the value column `count`. Then we will "gather" all 8 crime type columns, from `murder` to `arson`. The output is a reshaepd dataset that is 8-times "longer" than the input (4,080 = 510 * 8). The name of each input column is now turned into a value for the `type` column, and the corresponding crime count is a value for the `count` column.

```{r}
ispcrime_2 %>%
  gather(key = "type", value = "count", murder:arson)
```

Now, to see that `spread()` is the opposite process, here we show the result of `gather()`-ing and than `spread()`-ing the `ispcrime_2` object. The final output is in the same shape as the input.

```{r}
ispcrime_2 %>%
  gather(key = "type", value = "count", murder:arson) %>%
  spread(key = type, value = count)
```


## Unite multiple columns into one
```{r eval=FALSE}
unite(tbl, col, ..., sep = "_", remove = TRUE)
```
`unite()` works to combine multiple columns into a single column by concatenating their values. Its first argument is a tabular data object. Then, `col` is a new column created by "uniting" the following column inputs (`...`). `sep` input is a string to be inserted as a seperator between column values when concatenation takes place. The default value for `sep` is the underscore symbol (`_`). Finally, `remove` takes a boolean value for whether removing the original columns or not.


## Split a column into many
```{r eval=FALSE}
separate(tbl, col, into, sep = "[^[:alnum:]]+", remove = TRUE, ...)
```
`separate()` is the opposite of `unite()`. As in `unite()`, the first argument is a tabular data object. Here, `col` is a column to be split into multiple columns. `into` is a character vector for separated column names, which may have two or more elements. `sep` is a separator between values, which could be `_`, or any other. Finally, `remove` is a boolean for whether removing the original columns or not.

`unite()` and `sperate()` are great for cleaning up date or name variables. One common application is to convert two columns for "last name" and "first name" into a single column for "full name", or vice versa.


### Example
The following example illustrates the use of `unite()` and `separate()`. We first prepare a data object for this exercise: we `left_join()` `ispcrime` and `regions` and `select()` only six columns in the following order: `year`, `region`, `county`, `volentCrime`, and `propertyCrime`. This transformed data is assigned to `ispcrime_3`.

```{r}
ispcrime_3 <- ispcrime %>%
  left_join(regions) %>%
  select(year, region, county, violentCrime, propertyCrime) %>%
  as_tibble()

ispcrime_3
```

Now, we will try `unite()` on `region` and `county` columns to create a `region_county` column. Notice that we do not provide any input for `sep` argument and, accordingly, the default separator, `"_"`, is used to concatenate the two columns.

```{r}
ispcrime_3 %>%
  unite(col = region_county, region, county)
```

To see that `unite()` and `separate()` are the opposite procedures, we show the result of `unite()`-ing and `separate()`-ing the `ispcrime_3` data. Note that we have to provide `"_"` as the `sep` input to gain back the original input.

```{r}
ispcrime_3 %>%
  unite(col = region_county, region, county) %>%
  separate(col = region_county, into = c("region", "county"), sep = "_")
```


## Split a row into many
```{r eval=FALSE}
separate_rows(tbl, ..., sep = "[^[:alnum:]]+", ...)
```
We also have `separate_rows()`, which is similar to `separate()`, except the former results in a longer table while the latter results in a wider table. 


## More on `tidyr` {#tidyr_more}

As in the earlier `dplyr` case, what we have seen is only part of what `tidyr` offers. I recommend you to check out the following resources to learn more about `tidyr`

* `tidyr` on [tidyverse.org](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)
* `tidyr` [CRAN documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/tidyr.pdf)
* `tidyr` [Github repository](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr)
