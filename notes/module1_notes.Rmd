# Introduction to the Workshop

## Instructor (Bobae Kang)

My name is Bobae Kang and I am a Research Analyst at ICJIA. I have been using R for more than one year at the time of writing, and I believe that R is one of the most powerful modern computational tools for research and data analysis. I have developed this workshop to invite my colleagues and fellow researchers at ICJIA to start taking advantage of this amazing tool. See [About Me](../about.html) to read more about me.

## Workshop objectives

This workshop is developed to offer a gentle introduction to the R programming language for ICJIA researchers. More specifically, the goal of this workshop is to enable and empower its participants to:

* Import and manipulate tabular data files using R;
* Create simple data visualizations (scatterplot, histogram, bar chart, line chart, etc.) to extract insight from data using R;
* Perform basic statistical analysis using R;
* Generate a report on a simple data analysis task using R;
* Understand the basic elements of the R programming language;
* Employ the programmatic approach to research and data analysis projects; and
* Leverage online resources to find solutions to specific questions on using R for a given task.

Of course, mastering any of the listed skills requires more than this workshop. *This workshop alone will not make any of its participants an expert R programmer.* However, it will help the participants to get started and provide them with the basic skills and techniques in using R for research and data analysis. Ultimately, this workshop seeks to help the participants to gain the knowledge and confidence necesary to learn what they need to know for their own research projects.

## What is R?

> "R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics." - The R Foundation

* *Built for* data analysis and visualization
* One of the the most popular choices of programming language among academic researchers and data scientists
    * The following figure captures the growth of R in the recent years, compared to other programming languages. Although the data used to generate this figure does not provide the whole picture, it certainly reflects the reality where R has established itself as one of the most popular tool for researchers and data analysts.

</p>

## Why R?

* Open source (free!)
    * Being open source also means that its source code, much of which is written in C and Fortran as well as R itself, is open for anyone to review and (albeit rarely) contribute.
* Built for statistical analysis
    * R, at its very core, is designed for statistical computing. As such, a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques, which are often offered as preminum add-ons in other commercial tools, are part of the language's core pacakge.
* Reproducible and transparent
    * Saving one's R code as an R script can be used to easily reproduce any data manipulation and analysis. Such reproducibility ensures the maximal clarity regarding which inputs are used for analysis and which steps are taken to generate the output. A high degree of reproducibility of analysis can also greatly enhance productivity in a collaborative project; collaborators can share their work in the R script format to quickly reach a shared understanding of the progress.
    * As stated above, R is an open source. This open-source nature of R gives the language the level of transparency that other commercial softwares cannot afford. Also most of R packages are also open source, making it possible for any interested user to see precisely how things work under the hood.
* Extensible through powerful third-party packages
* Supported by its active user community
    * The strong R community is often considered as one of the key advantages of using the language.[^1]
* Enabling researchers to tackle a variety of tasks using a *single* platform
    * Data manipulation and analyiss
    * Basic and advanced statistical modeling
    * Publication-ready data visualization
    * Generating reports in various formats (html webpage, MS word, PDF)
    * Slideshows, websites, interactive dashboards, etc.

## Comparisons

### R vs Excel
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-2">
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("../images/excel-logo.png")
```
</div>
<div class="col-xs-10">
* License cost
    * Although often taken for granted, the MS Office Suite is in fact not free. In contrast, **R is free.** (Of course, this may be a moot point since other MS Office Suite products are well loved and widely used on daily basis.) 
* Speed and scalability
    * Excel is slow, and its performance quickly deteriorates as the data size grows. R offers many tools highly optimized to work with large data.
    * Excel has limits on the number of rows and columns on a worksheet (1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns). R does not.
* Visualization
    * While Excel provides some basic visualzation options, it is difficult in Excel to create highly customized and publication-quality plots. R can achieve this with only several lines of code.
* Complex and advanced analysis
    * Data manipulation capability of R is simply superior to that of Excel.
    * Although Excel does offer a variety of built-in functions for data analysis to many people's surprise, users are still limited to the built-in options. Not only R comes with advanced data analysis functionalities, they can also be easily exended with add-on pacakges.
* Reproducibility
    * Reproducibility can be achieved in Excel to only a limited extent, any marginally complex analysis in Excel becomes extremely difficult to reproduce.
</div>
</div>

### R vs SPSS

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-2">
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("../images/spss-logo.png")
```
</div>
<div class="col-xs-10">
* License cost (again)
    * At the time of writing, the Base pricing option for SPSS is $99 per user per month. In addition, add-ons for other advanced functionalities must be purchased separately.[^2] **R is free.**
* Syntax
    * SPSS provides Syntax to programmatically perform data clearing, analysis and statistical modeling tasks. However, it is often noted that the grammatical/syntactic structure of SPSS Syntax is difficult to use (especially for complex operations) and often at odds with the programming standards in general.[^3] R, on the other hand, follows much of the standard grammar of modern programming languages. In addition, many tutorials on the basics of R language are readily available.
* Visualization
    * Although SPSS offers basic visualization options for commonly used charts and graphs, just as in Excel, only minimal customization is available and the outputs are little better than Excel graphs.
* Reporting
    * SPSS is capable for quickly generating a report on the data, but the output is merely functional. On the other hand, R offers RMarkdown documents that can be used to generate highly customized, publication-ready reports and articles in various formats: html webpage, MS Word, and PDF document.

### R vs Tableau

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-2">
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("../images/tableau-logo.png")
```
</div>
<div class="col-xs-10">
* License cost (DUH!)
    * At the time of writing, the Professional Edition of Tableau Desktop software costs $70 per user per month. Also, to store data sources and workbooks securely, an additional cost of $35 per user per month for Tableau Server must be paid.[^4] **R is free.**
* Reproducibility
    * Tableau is first and foremost a Graphic User Interface tool. Accordingly, communicating the process of making the workbook is much difficult in Tableau although it is possible to share Tableau workbooks with others. (See above for more on the benefits of reproducibility.)
* Data manipulation
    * Although Tableau offers some useful data manipulation features, its focus is visualization. As a result, Tableau's data manipulation features are limited to meet the real-life needs and its users often need to rely on another tool to prepare data for use in Tableau.[^5]
    * It is telling that Tableau offers an R integration functionality to create complex parameters. If this is the case, why not use R itself in its native environment?
* Complex and advanced analysis
    * Tableau's focus of quick-and-simple data visualization makes the tool largely unfit for conducting and thereby visualizing complex data analysis and statistical modeling results. R, on the other hand, is fully capable of handle both tasks of high-quality data visualization and advanced data analysis as well as modeling, either separately or jointly.
</div>
</div>

[^4]: See the official Tableau [**Pricing page**](https://www.tableau.com/pricing) for more information.

[^5]: See [**this article from AIM Consulting**](https://aimconsulting.com/insights/blog/1-mistake-customers-make-tableau/) for more on the limitation of Tableau's data manipulation functionality with an example.

This is not to say that these tools (Excel, SPSS, and Tableau) are simply inferior to R in all aspects. Each software is designed with a specific set of tasks and comes with the ease of use for the right tasks. Furthermore, compared to these tools, R has a relatively steep learning curve, which makes it difficult for anyone without sufficient background knowledge to quickly master and use it for real tasks.

Nonetheless, R is a highly performant, versatile, and flexible tool for research and data analysis that is also largely compatible with any of the tools above. That said, R is a great addition to any researcher's toolbox, and it can easily be the most preferred choice of tool.

## What is RStudio? Why use it?

* Best Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R
    * Although there are other IDEs supporting R, RStudio is a *de facto* standard tool in the R community and comes with many great features to extend R's power beyond statistical computing.
* Powerful and convenient features
    * Advanced debugging tools
    * RMarkdown integration
    * Shiny integration
    * R Presentation integration
* Interactive workflow
* Open source (again!)
    * Although RStudio, Inc. offers paid options for the IDE, which comes with additional support, the open source version, which is free of charge, can meet practicaly all needs of any researcher.
* ... and many more!
