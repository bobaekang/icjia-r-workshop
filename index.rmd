# First R Workshop in ICJIA

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-8 col-xs-12">
This workshop is planned to offer a gentle introduction to the R programming language for ICJIA researchers who want to leverage the power and flexibility of R to improve their technical prowess as researcher. R is more than a simple statistical sofeware and is capable of being a full-fledged research platform. The workshop participants will learn the basics of R and how R can be used for data analysis, visualization, statistical modeling, and much more. The workshop is for not only those with little to no previous programming experience but also those who already use R for research to some extent but want to expand their understanding of R as well as its applications.

## Workshop insturctor
My name is Bobae Kang and I am a Research Analyst at ICJIA. I have been using R for more than one year at the time of writing, and I believe that **R is one of the most powerful modern computational tools for research and data analysis**.[^1] I have developed this workshop to invite my colleagues and fellow researchers at ICJIA to start taking advantage of this amazing tool. See [**About Me**](about.html#about-me) to read more about me.

[^1]: For example, this website as well as all workshop materials (notes and slides) are generated using R.
